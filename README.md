# ☁️ Accessing S3 from an EC2 Instance in a VPC: AWS Integration Project

---

## Project Overview  
I combined **Amazon VPC, EC2, and S3** to enable secure access between a compute instance and an external AWS service. This project helped me explore **IAM access control**, **CLI interaction**, and **network architecture** inside a custom VPC.

---

## Project Highlights  
### What I Did:  
- 🌐 **Set Up a Custom VPC**: Launched an EC2 instance within an isolated cloud network.  
- 🔑 **Configured IAM Access**: Set up appropriate IAM access keys for the EC2 instance to interact with S3.  
- 🖥 **Accessed EC2 Instance**: Used **EC2 Instance Connect** to access the instance securely.
- 📦 **Used AWS CLI**: Interacted with an S3 bucket from the EC2 instance using the AWS CLI.

---

### Next Phase:  
- 🔒 **Enhanced Security**: Implement additional **IAM roles** and **security groups** for tighter access control.  
- 🛠 **Monitoring & Automation**: Set up **AWS CloudWatch** and **CloudTrail** for tracking access logs and automating tasks.  
- 🌍 **Networking & Peering**: Explore VPC peering and private networking options to expand connectivity options.

## Why Amazon VPC?  
Amazon VPC provides an isolated, secure networking environment for your cloud resources, offering fine-grained control over network configurations. By combining **VPC, EC2, and S3**, this project showcases how to build a secure architecture with proper access control and resource management.
